Date/Time: 11/21/24

Participants: Emily, Kayleen, Benjamin, Dennis, Nahum

Notes...
What went well: This sprint successfully laid the foundation of what the team wants the web app to look like. Incuding diagrams and user stories to aid in understanding of our project goals. Foundational aspects of the web page like user registration, authentication, listing of student information, and deleting student information were implememented. Setting up the database was also succesful allowing us to set up a solid foundation for the continued development of our web app. The team was succesful in mainting clear communication through daily sprint meetings. 

Summary: The team met the sprint goal by implementing critical user functionality, establishing a functional database, and setting up the basic project structure. Weâ€™re now well-positioned to proceed with the next sprint, adding advanced features like creating student information and search/create functionality.
