Participants: Emily, Kayleen, Benjamin, Dennis, Nahum

Goal Statement: The goal for Sprint 2 is to complete US#3: Search Student Information, US#5: Create Student Information, and US#7: Update Student Information. 

US#3 Search Student Information:
Search Student Information is a core aspect of the Student Management app, it enables users to search for and explore current student information. This user story will focus on creating a search form with filters for various parameters, such as student name, student id, major, and academic year. Once a user submits their search criteria, they will be directed to a results page displaying relevant student information. This feature will allow users to quickly find specific students or information, and its design will accommodate future expansions. Testing will verify that the search returns accurate and filtered results, ensuring a functional and responsive experience.


US#5 Create Student Information:
Create Student Information to facilitate comprehensive data entry, administrators will be able to create new student entries within the app. This user story involves designing a form where admins can enter detailed information, like a unique ID, Enrollment Date, student name, major, and academic year. Once submitted, the data will be stored in the database, adding a new student. This feature empowers admins to keep the database current and reflective of rcurrent student information. Thorough validation and testing will confirm accurate data entry and storage, enhancing the database's reliability and usability.

US#7 Update Student Information:
Update Student Information to maintain the accuracy and relevance of student data, administrators need the ability to update existing entries. In this user story, we will implement functionality that allows admins to retrieve an student's details, make edits, and save changes back to the database. Editable fields will include core details like name, academic year, and major. This feature will help keep the student data current and accurate, reflecting any updates or corrections. Testing will verify that changes are applied correctly.
