Participants: Emily, Kayleen, Benjamin, Dennis, Nahum

Goal Statement: The goal for Sprint 3 is to complete US#8: Graduate, Testing requirements, and deployment requriements including code standards.

US#8 Graduate:
User story 8, Graduate is meant to confirm that upon clicking the "Request Graduation" button for a particular student the system can confirm whether they satisfy the requirements for graduation. In order to calculate if the student meets graduation requirements users must also be able to "View transcript" that displays the students informations like acedmic year, gpa  and credits for a given year, total gpa and total credits. As well as access "Grade Management" that displays the students existing grades as well as allows admins to add or update said grades. If the credit is greater than 120 and the GPA is greater than 2.0, the student has satisfied the graduation requirements and is approved for graduation. This feature is essential to a elevating our student management system by allowing a crucial functionality for educators.

Testing:
Whitebox testing and Balckbox testing to test internal and external structure of our web app need to implemnted to ensure proper functionality.
Test coverage using python coverage should also be included, despite no particular code coverage requirement.

Code Standards:
We must ensure code complies with the PEP8 code style standard.
